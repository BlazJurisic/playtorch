# PyTorch core library for React Native

The PyTorch core library for React Native is part of the PyTorch Live project. Please follow the instructions provided on the [PyTorch Live website](https://pytorch.org/live) as outlined below!

## üéâ Building your first PyTorch Live app
Follow the [Getting Started guide](https://pytorch.org/live/docs/tutorials/get-started). PyTorch Live offers a CLI with convenient commands to install development dependencies and initialize new projects. We also have a few tutorials for you to keep going after getting started:

* [Image Classification](https://pytorch.org/live/docs/tutorials/image-classification)
* [Question Answering](https://pytorch.org/live/docs/tutorials/question-answering)
* [Prepare Custom Model](https://pytorch.org/live/docs/tutorials/prepare-custom-model)

## üìñ Documentation

The full documentation for PyTorch Live can be found on our [website](https://pytorch.org/live/).

## Example Usage

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import {Button, StyleSheet, Text, View} from 'react-native';

import {MobileModel, ImageUtil} from 'react-native-pytorch-core';

// Have a look at how to prepare a model for PyTorch Live
// https://pytorch.org/live/docs/tutorials/prepare-custom-model/
const model = require('./mobilenet_v3_small.ptl');

// JSON array of classes that map the max idx to a class label
const IMAGE_CLASSES = require('./image_classes.json');

type ImageClassificationResult = {
  maxIdx: number;
  confidence: number;
};

export default function ImageClassificaion() {
  const [topClass, setTopClass] = React.useState<string>('');
  async function classifyImage() {
    const image = await ImageUtil.fromURL('https://pytorch.org/example.jpg');
    const {metrics, result} =
      await MobileModel.execute<ImageClassificationResult>(model, {
        image,
      });

    console.log(metrics);
    if (result.confidence > 0.7) {
      setTopClass(IMAGE_CLASSES[result.maxIdx]);
    } else {
      setTopClass('low confidence');
    }
  }

  return (
    <View style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill}>
      <Button title="Classify Image" onPress={classifyImage} />
      <Text>{topClass}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
