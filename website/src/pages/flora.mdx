# The Flora App

*Flora* is an multimodal learning app built with PlayTorch. It was built through a collaboration between the PlayTorch team and PhD students in Stanford University's Human-Computer Interaction Graduate Program.

The app presents a sample lesson about eucalyptus trees in California and makes use of "multimodal learning" -- learning that happens through a variety of different modes like visual, kinaesthetic, reading, writing and speaking. PlayTorch enabled us to quickly integrate a variety of machine learning models that make the learning experience interactive and engaging.

## Try it out

You can try out Flora for yourself!

To get started follow these steps:

1. Download the PlayTorch app onto an iOS or Android device. [TODO: Add link]
2. Open the PlayTorch app and use it to scan the QR code on the right side of this Expo Snack [TODO: Add link].
3. Start the lesson! Your first task is to find a eucalyptus tree and scan it using the custom-tuned imagenet classifier. If you don't have a eucalyptus tree nearby try using one of these [pictures](https://www.google.com/search?q=eucalyptus+tree&rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS992US992&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiMje_M8NX4AhWPDkQIHYNhCGkQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1964&bih=1117&dpr=1#imgrc=_iXbgljkmKDk4M).

PlayTorch allowed our team to quickly integrate and use three different machine learning models, which you'll see as you engage with the app:
1. The imagenet classifier for identifying tree types
2. The wav2vec model, which enables high-quality speech-to-text.
3. The BERT QA model for answering basic questions about eucalyptus trees.
