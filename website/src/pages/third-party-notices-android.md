    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but

    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

    and conversions to other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object

    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes

    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

2.  Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3.  Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

    as of the date such litigation is filed.

4.  Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

    the conditions stated in this License.

5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed

    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6.  Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7.  Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8.  Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,

    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly

    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be

    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability

    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

LEGAL ISSUES

============

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!)

2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us.

3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.

All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:

(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.

(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".

(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it. This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.

ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.

It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.

The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many

implementations will support it.)

So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.

To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.

We are required to state that

> "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE

Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting â in part or in whole â any of the components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the following conditions:

1. Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2. Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3. No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented to the users.

4. The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.

5. The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the Font Software.

TERMINATION

This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.

DISCLAIMER

THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.
