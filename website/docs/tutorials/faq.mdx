## Mobile Models

### Q: Is it possible to secure a model that will be downloaded into PyTorch Live?

A: PyTorch does not provide security at the model-level. Most mobile platforms such as iOS and Android cannot guarantee secure transmission and storage of ML models as hardware-level security is unavailable to the apps.

If security of ML model is desired then you may get close by turning off debugging and backup in the app manifest for Android. If you do this then the data stored in your local app data directory cannot be extracted without rooting the device.

Another possibility is to encrypt the model and store the encrypted model in the underlying platform-provided secure location. This will likely increase latency and may impact other metrics that your app may care about. You may want to consider securing the ML model using any mechanism that you use for securing other valuable assets in use by the app.
