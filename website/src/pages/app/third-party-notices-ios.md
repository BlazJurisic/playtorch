    and conversions to other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object

    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes

    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3.  Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

    as of the date such litigation is filed.

4.  Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

    the conditions stated in this License.

5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed

    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6.  Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7.  Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8.  Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,

    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly

    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be

    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability

    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

CC0 1.0 Universal

> CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer

exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator

and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of

authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for

the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and

scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear

of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other

works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever

and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free

culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific

works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in

part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any

expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person

associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she

is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily

elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its

terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the

Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be

protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and

Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not

limited to, the following:

i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;

ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;

iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;

vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention

of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,

irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of

Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes

of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as

future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories

worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or

treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future

medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,

including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional

purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each

member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and

successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to

revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or

equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public

as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason

be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the

Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into

account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the

extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected

person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,

irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and

Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the

maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future

time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number

of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without

limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the

"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was

applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any

reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such

partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder

of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she

will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related

Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of

action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's

express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.

d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions. a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope. a. License grant. 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material. 5. Downstream recipients. A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

b. Other rights. 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. a. Attribution. 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. 4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation. a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

Creative Commons Legal Code

CC0 1.0 Universal

> CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer

exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator

and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of

authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for

the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and

scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear

of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other

works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever

and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free

culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific

works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in

part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any

expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person

associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she

is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily

elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its

terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the

Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be

protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and

Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not

limited to, the following:

i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;

ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;

iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;

vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention

of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,

irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of

Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes

of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as

future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories

worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or

treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future

medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,

including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional

purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each

member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and

successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to

revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or

equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public

as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason

be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the

Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into

account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the

extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected

person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,

irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and

Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the

maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future

time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number

of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without

limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the

"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was

applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any

reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such

partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder

of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she

will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related

Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of

action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's

express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.

d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.
