# GPTClient Example Files

This folder contains code for each checkpoint of the "Connecting to a Server Model" tutorial.

The contents of the `tsx` files can replace the content of the `src/demos/MyDemos.tsx` file in an app created by running the command `npx torchlive-cli init <PROJECT_NAME>`

The `xml` file in this folder can replace the content of the `android/app/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml` though you must update it to use your computer's IP address. It's only necessary if you want to test with a physical Android device.
